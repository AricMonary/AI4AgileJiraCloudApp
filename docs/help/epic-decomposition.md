## Epic Decomposition  
### Purpose  
Epic Decomposition seeks to assist with user story refinement by breaking Epics or collections of user stories into individual stories.  

### Getting Started  
1. Input your Epic text in the description section of a Jira Epic.
2. Click the `Epic Decomposition` button.
3. (optional) Adjust the `Number of Stories` slider as desired.
4. Select the stories you want to create, clicking the text to edit as needed. There is also a `Select/Deselect All` toggle.
5. Click `Create Selected` either as you go or at the end of the editing and selecting process to generate the new stories.
6. Refresh the page to see the newly created stories either above the selected Epic (if on the Issues page), or below that Epic's dropdown (if on the Roadmap page).

### Troubleshooting  
- If the issues you've created don't show up after clicking the button, you may need to refresh the page.
- If the amount of outputted stories doesn't change with different slider values, the input text may be too short to make any difference.
- Edits to issues won't be saved if you change the slider value or close the issue panel without creating those issues.
- Changes to the Description text will require the refresh button (located next to `Create Selected`) to be used before those changes are seen in the generated stories.
