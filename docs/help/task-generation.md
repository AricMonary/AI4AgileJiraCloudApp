## Task Generation  
### Purpose  
The idea for the Task Generation process is to assist users in creating tasks from user stories, to finish the the user story refinement journey.  

### Getting Started  
1. Input a user story in a Jira Story's Description section, or use one from the output of the [Story Optimization](https://aricmonary.github.io/AI4AgileJiraCloudApp/help/story-optimization.html) process.
2. Click the `Task Generation` button to open the panel.
3. Select the tasks you want to create, clicking the text to edit as needed. There is also a `Select/Deselect All` toggle.
4. Click `Create Selected` either as you go or at the end of the editing and selecting process to generate the new tasks.
5. Refresh the page to see the newly created tasks either above the selected issue (if on the Issues page), or below the selected issue (if on the Roadmap page).  

### Troubleshooting  
- If the newly created tasks don't appear automatically after a short while, try refreshing the browser page.
- It's possible for fragmented sentences to appear in the suggestions with certain sentence structures. If this happens, the tasks can be edited either during the creation process or after, in the individual issue panels.
