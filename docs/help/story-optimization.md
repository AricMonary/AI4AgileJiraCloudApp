## Story Optimization  
### Purpose  
The Story Optimization process seeks to aid users in further refining user stories down to a more manageable level from which to create highly related Tasks.  

### Getting Started  
1. Input a user story in a Jira Story's Description section, or use one from the output of the [Epic Decomposition](https://aricmonary.github.io/AI4AgileJiraCloudApp/help/epic-decomposition.html) process.
2. Click the `Story Optimization` button to open the panel.
3. (optional) Adjust the connectivity threshold for your stories as desired with the `Degree of Connectivity` slider.
4. Select the stories you want to create, clicking the text to edit as needed. There is also a `Select/Deselect All` toggle.
5. Click `Create Selected` either as you go or at the end of the editing and selecting process to generate the new stories.
6. Refresh the page to see the newly created stories either above the selected issue (if on the Issues page), or below the selected issue (if on the Roadmap page). 

### Troubleshooting  
- If the new issues don't show up, try refreshing the browser page.
- If the suggested stories don't change with different slider values, the current story may not have significant enough variation to split upon.
