## Overview
AI4Agile leverages Artificial Intelligence to assist agile users of Atlassian's Jira in refining user stories. Jira is a work management tool and issue tracker that can be used by agile or non-agile developers.


## Main Features

- **Epic Decomposition**: decomposes an epic, a combination of requirements and specifications, into user stories.
- **Story Optimization**: optimizes user stories into smaller stories.
- **Task Generation**: breaks stories down into simple tasks.
- **Dependency Visualization**: generates a graph of explicit and implicit relationships between stories, tasks, and epics.

## General Usage
Clicking on an issue will open the issue view panel. If an Epic (purple icon) has been selected, among the buttons below the `Title` field you'll see one for `Dependency Vizualization` and another for `Epic Decomposition.` The Dependency Vizualization tool is visible on all issue types. If a Story (green icon) is selected, the options will include `Story Optimization` and `Task Generation.` Using the decomposition, optimization, or generation tools will generate suggestions (`Suggestion Panel`) for stories or tasks that can be created.
